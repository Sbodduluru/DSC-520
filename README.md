# Heart disease Prediction
Statistics for Data Science
 Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States. About 610,000 people die of heart disease
 in the United States every year-that's 1 in every 4 deaths. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than 
 half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men. Using this dataset I would like to predict the presence of heart disease for 
 a patient. The variables in the dataset explains the various test reports of the patient. If we can predict the heart disease in advance 
 depending upon the various test reports, it will be really helpful to control them or take precautionary measures to avoid them by taking 
 necessary steps.
